# GitHub-Search

GitHub Search allows you to search for your favorite GitHub repository in real time.

GitHub Search functionalities include:

1. Search for GitHub repositories and returns a list of 10 matching repositories.
2. Scroll to the bottom to fetch another 10 repositories and so on. If the repository list is fully fetched, it will not fetch any more data.
3. Click on a GitHub repository name to navigate to the GitHub repository on an external browser.
